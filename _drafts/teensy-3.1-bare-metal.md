title: Low Level Bare Metal Programming On The Teensy 3.1 
---

In this post I will be looking how to program a teensy 3.1 from scratch. If you want a more full featured example take a look at Karl Lunt's post on the topic, however does not explain what most of the files he includes in his example actually do.

This post follows the tutorials at [Embedded Programming with the GNU Toolchain)[http://bravegnu.org/gnu-eprog/] but focuses on the teensy 3.1. I recomend reading those tutorials first if you want a deeper understanding.
